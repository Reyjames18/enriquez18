	<h2>
		Junior High was a very good experience for me, it was filled with excitement. I would always walk down the hallway knowing everyone and every teacher, but I would always think about going to highschool. I wanted to leave junior high and go to highschool so bad. I remember I would always say ¨I can't wait till highschool¨ but when I left the place where all my memories were made , where I felt most comfortable I noticed things about myself. I noticed that I took junior high for granted I didn't even think about all the things that I would miss, I was just so caught up with school. I wish I could go back in time and just relive some of my junior high days. When I came to high school I realized many new things about myself.
